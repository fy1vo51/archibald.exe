Tutorials for a prank
* * * * * * * * * * * *

If you'd like to prank your friends, just copy archibald.exe to any folders
and rename it to your own filename but let the ".exe" extension, don't forget to copy 3 dlls files to work
properly but you can hide these files using right click, properties and
check the hidden box that anyone don't know there's a dlls files.

You can create a shortcut to your desktop and make your name then you can
select any icons as you want.

Good luck!

If you want to do a prank without any computers got crashed,
add an command line -nocrash on target field of the properties box (Shortcuts only)
or you can create a batch file (.bat) and write the following
line: archibald -nocrash then create a shortcut to the desktop
and change icon and name.
Don't forget to add @echo off at the first line
that people won't see the line on the Command Prompt!
