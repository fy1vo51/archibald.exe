Tutorials for a prank
* * * * * * * * * * * *

If you'd like to prank your friends, just copy archibald.exe to any folders
and rename it to your own filename but let the ".exe" extension, don't forget to copy 3 dlls files to work
properly but you can hide these files using right click, properties and
check the hidden box that anyone don't know there's a dlls files.

You can create a shortcut to your desktop and make your name then you can
select any icons as you want.

Good luck!
